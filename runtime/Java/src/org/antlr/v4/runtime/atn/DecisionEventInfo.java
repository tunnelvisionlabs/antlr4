/**
 * This is the base class for gathering detailed information about prediction
 * events which occur during parsing.
 *
 * Note that we could record the parser call stack at the time this event
 * occurred but in the presence of left recursive rules, the stack is kind of
 * meaningless. It's better to look at the individual configurations for their
 * individual stacks. Of course that is a {@link PredictionContext} object
 * not a parse tree node and so it does not have information about the extent
 * (start...stop) of the various subtrees. Examining the stack tops of all
 * configurations provide the return states for the rule invocations.
 * From there you can get the enclosing rule.
